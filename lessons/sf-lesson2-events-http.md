# **Lesson 2 â€” Events, HTTP Serving, and Express**

## **Lesson Overview**

**Learning objective**: Students will gain familiarity with event emitters and listeners.  Students will use the Node http package to create an HTTP server that handles a few routes and responds with JSON.  Students will create a POST route in the http server and test it using Postman.  Students will learn the elements of Express and will create a basic Express server.
**Topics**:

1. Event Emitters and Listeners.
2. A Simple HTTP Server
3. Testing with Postman
4. Introducing Express

## **Understanding the Layers: HTTP vs Node vs Express**

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the distinction between these three concepts:

### **HTTP (Protocol Layer)**
- **What it is**: A standardized protocol for how clients and servers communicate over the web
- **What it defines**: Request/response format, methods (GET, POST, etc.), status codes, headers
- **Where it lives**: In the network - it's the language that browsers and servers speak to each other

### **Node.js HTTP Module (Low-level Implementation)**
- **What it is**: Node's built-in way to create HTTP servers using the HTTP protocol
- **What it provides**: Raw access to HTTP requests/responses, manual parsing, basic server creation
- **Level of abstraction**: Low - you handle everything manually (parsing bodies, setting headers, routing)

### **Express.js (High-level Framework)**
- **What it is**: A web framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies HTTP server creation
- **What it provides**: Automatic parsing, middleware system, routing, error handling
- **Level of abstraction**: High - Express handles the HTTP complexity so you can focus on business logic

**Think of it this way**: HTTP is the language, Node HTTP is the manual translation, and Express is the automatic translator that makes everything easier.

## **2.1 Event Emitters and Listeners**

Event emitters allow communication between different parts of an application.  Once an event emitter has been created, listeners can sign up to get called whenever the emitter emits an event.  An event has a name, and may also pass various arguments to the listeners.  Create a file called events-intro.js in your node-homework/assignment2 folder, and put in the following code:

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on("tell", (message) => {
  // this registers a listener
  console.log("listener 1 got a tell message:", message);
});

emitter.on("tell", (message) => {
  // listener 2.  You don't want too many in the chain
  console.log("listener 2 got a tell message:", message);
});

emitter.on("error", (error) => {
  // a listener for errors.  It's a good idea to have one per emitter
  console.log("The emitter reported an error.", error.message);
});

emitter.emit("tell", "Hi there!");
emitter.emit("tell", "second message");
emitter.emit("tell", "all done");
```

Try this program out.  We only have "tell" and "error" as event names in this case, but typically there would be more named events.  The listeners for a given event are called in the order they register, and the emitting of events is synchronous, although it be made asynchronous.

This may seem pretty simple, and it is -- but it enables you to write programs where one function communicates with many others, depending on the conditions.  The mainline code could have logic that says, if X happens, notify a, b, and c, but if Y happens, notify c and d.  This gives plugpoints where developers can add modules to listen for events.  This simple model is exploited extensively in the Node `http` package.

Another package you should know about in Node is the `net` package.  This allows you to create, for example, server processes for which the protocol is not HTTP.  Mail servers, Domain Name Servers, whatever you like.  We won't do that in this class.

## **2.2 A Simple HTTP Server**

The HTTP package, which is built into the Node base, allows you to create a server process that listens on a port.  Each time an HTTP request is received, the http server calls the callback you specify, passing a req object, which contains information from the request, and a res object, which gives you a way to send a response to the request.  Here is a sample.  Create a file in your `node-homework/assignment2` folder called `sampleHttp.js` with the following content. Then start the program in Node.

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer({ keepAliveTimeout: 60000 }, (req, res) => {
    
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
  res.end(JSON.stringify({
    data: 'Hello World!',
  }));
});

server.listen(8000);
```

You can access the server in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.  However, it doesn't do too much, in that, no matter what request you send to the server, all you get back is "Hello World".  The callback you provide for `(req, res)`  is called for every incoming request.  That callback, in this case, calls two methods of the res object: `res.writeHead()`, which puts the HTTP result code and a header into the response, and `res.end()`, which sends the actual data.  You note that your Node program keeps running.  In Node, if there is an open network operation, or a promise being waited on, or pending file I/O, the Node process keeps running.  You stop it with Ctrl-C.

When the server gets an inbound HTTP request, it parses the basic information describing the request, including, in particular, the method, the url, the headers, and the cookies, and then issues the callback.  All of that information is in the req object -- but not the body of the request, if any body is present.  The data in the body is not available until you do another step.  Let's add some logic:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer({ keepAliveTimeout: 60000 }, (req, res) => {
  if (
    req.method === "POST" &&
    req.url === "/" &&
    req.headers["content-type"] === "application/json"
  ) {
    let body = "";
    req.on("data", (chunk) => (body += chunk)); // this is how you assemble the body.
    req.on("end", () => { // this event is emitted when the body is completely assembled.  If there isn't a body, it is emitted when the request arrives.
      const parsedBody = JSON.parse(body);
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
      res.end(
        JSON.stringify({
          weReceived: parsedBody,
        }),
      );
    });
  } else if (req.method != "GET") {
    res.writeHead(404, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(
      JSON.stringify({
        message: "That route is not available.",
      }),
    );
  } else if (req.url.pathname === "/secret") {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(
      JSON.stringify({
        message: "The secret word is 'Swordfish'.",
      }),
    );
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(
      JSON.stringify({
        pathEntered: req.url,
      }),
    );
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The idea, which we'll pursue further when we get to Express, is that we have a look at the request, and depending on what is in it, we send the appropriate response.  Here, the logic checks the method, which is one of GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE, and the url.  In this case, the HTTP server provides not full URL but the URL path.  Depending on the values of the method and the path, different responses are returned.

If the server is running, stop it with a Ctrl-C, put in the code above, and restart it.  You can then try `http://localhost:8000/testPath` and `http://localhost:8000/secret` from your browser.  

## **2.3 Testing with Postman**

But, you also need to test the POST request.  For that you use Postman.  Browsers only send POST requests when a form is submitted.

Start Postman, and click on the New button on the upper right.  Select New Http Request.  You will see a pulldown that defaults to "GET".  Switch it to "POST".  Then, where it says "Enter Request URL", put in `http://localhost:8000`.  Then click on the "Body" tab, and select "raw".  Then, in the pulldown that defaults to "Text", choose "JSON".  Then paste the following into the body:

```JSON
{
    "firstAttribute": "value1",
    "secondAttribute": 42
}
```

Then, click on the send button, and see what you get back.  You get a JSON response in this case.  If you change the URL to `http://localhost:8000/not-here`, you'll see you get back a 404.

This is one perfectly valid way of creating a web application back end.  Your server could respond with any kind of data, including HTML, and could handle a variety of incoming requests.  As no doubt you have noticed, this is still pretty low level.  You have to add logic for each URL path and method.  You have to read the body.  You have to parse the body.  You have to handle errors if any.  For example, the code above will crash the server if the incoming JSON is invalid, because the parse will throw an error.  Fortunately, the Express package makes your development task much easier.

## **2.4 Introducing Express**

Express is not part of the Node base.  You need to do an `npm install express` while in your node-homework folder.  Express may already be part of your node-homework repository, but install it to be sure.  We are going to use Express to create a back end, a series of REST APIs.  Express can be used for other purposes, such as static file serving, or for server side rendered pages.  Server side rendering provides dynamic HTML using a templating language such as EJS or Pug.  We won't be doing that, and there are other more modern frameworks for server side rendered pages, such as JSX with NextJS.

**Key Difference from Node HTTP**: While the Node HTTP module gives you raw access to HTTP requests and requires you to manually parse bodies, set headers, and handle routing, Express automatically handles these low-level details. Express builds on top of Node's HTTP capabilities to provide a higher-level, more developer-friendly interface. Think of it as the difference between building a house from scratch (Node HTTP) versus using pre-made components (Express).

In the previous section on REST and HTTP, you learned about the components of an HTTP request: a method (such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE), a path, query parameters, headers, sometimes a body, and cookies.  In Express, you have the following elements:

1. An app, as created by a call to Express.

2. A collection of route handlers.  A request for a particular HTTP method and path are sent to a route handler.  For example, a POST for /notices would have a route handler that handles this route.  A route handler is a function with the parameters req, res, and sometimes next.  The req parameter is a structure with comprehensive information about the request.  The res parameter is the way that the route handler sends the response.  The next parameter is needed in case the route handler needs to throw an error to an error handler.

3. Middleware.  Middleware functions do some initial processing on the request.  Sometimes a middleware function checks to see if the request should be sent on to the next piece of middleware in the chain or the route handler.  If not, the middleware itself returns a response to the request.  In other cases, a middleware function may add additional information to the req object, and may also set headers, including sometimes set-cookie headers, in the res object.  Then it calls next(), which might call another middleware function, or might call a route handler. Middleware functions typically have three parameters, req, res, and next.  A standard piece of middleware you'll create is the not-found handler, which is invoked when no route handler could be found for the method and path.

4. An error handler.  This is at the end of the chain, in case an error occurs.  There is only one error handler, and it takes four parameters, err, req, res, and next, which is how Express knows it is an error handler.

5. A server.  This is created as a result of an app.listen() on a port.

The mainline code in the app does the following:

1. It creates the app.

2. It specifies a chain of middleware functions and route handlers to be called, each with filter conditions based on the method and path of the request.  These conditions determine each should be called.  Middleware functions are configured in the chain via an app.use() statement.  Route handlers are configured in the chain via app.get(), app.post(), and similar statements.

**Order matters in this configuration.**  The first app.use(), app.get(), or other such statement that is matched determines what function is called.  If that is a middleware function, it will often do a next, and then the next middleware function or route handler in the chain that matches the HTTP method and path is called.  While middleware often does a next(), route handlers only do a next(err), in cases when an error should be passed to the error handler.

3. It tells the app to listen on a port.

## **An example Express Server**

Here is an example of what an Express app.js might look like.  This is just an example -- you don't need to put this code in a file.

```js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

// the following statements configure the chain of middleware and route handlers.  Nothing happens with them until a request is received.

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // this is called for every request received.  All methods, all paths
  req.additional = { this: 1, that: "two" };
  const content = req.get("content-type");
  if (req.method == "POST" && content != "application/json") {
    next(new Error("A bad content type was received")); // this invokes the error handler
  } else {
    next(); // as OK data was received, the request is passed on to it.
  }
});

app.get("/info", (req, res) => {
  // this is only called for get requests for the specific path
  res.send("We got good stuff here!");
});

app.use("/api", (req, res, next) => {
  // this is called for all methods, but only if the path begins with /api
  // and only if the request got past that first middleware.
  // ...
});

app.use((req, res) => {
  // this is the not found handler.  Nothing took care of the request, so we send the caller the bad news.  You always need one of these.
  res.status(404).send("That route is not present.");
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => { // The error handler.  You always need one.
  console.log(err.constructor.name, err.message, err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("internal server error");
});

let server = null;

try {
  server = app.listen(3000);
  console.log("server up and running.");
} catch {
  console.log("couldn't get access to the port.");
}
```

Of course, for a real app, the route handlers and middleware functions would not be declared inline.  Suppose one set of route handlers deals with customers, via GET/POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE requests on all paths that start with `/customers`, and suppose you have another set for `/orders`.  Typically you would have a `./controllers` folder, with a `customerController.js` for all the route handlers for customers and an `orderController.js` for all the route handlers for orders.  Typically also, you would have a `./routes` folder, for modules that create express routers.  An express router is a way of associating a collection of routes with a collecton of route handlers.  You'd also have a middleware folder.  In the mainline code, you might have statements like:

```js
const customerRouter = require("./routes/customer")
const customerMiddleware = require("./middleware/customerAuth)
app.use("/customers", customerAuth, customerRouter)
```

The customerMiddleware function might check if the customer is logged in.  If not, it could send a response with a 401 status code, possibly with an error message in the body.  If a customer is logged in, the middleware function might add additional information to the req object.  It would call next, so that processing would pass to the customerRouter.

For each request sent to the server, there must be exactly one response.  If no response is sent, a user might be waiting at the browser for a timeout.  If several responses are sent for one request, Express reports an error instead of sending the second one.

## **What do Request Handlers Do?**

Request handlers may retrieve data and send it back to the caller.  Or, they may store, modify, or delete data, and report the success or failure to the caller.  Or, they may manage the session state of the caller, as would happen, for example, with a logon.  The data accessed by request handlers may be in a database, or it may be accessed via some network request.  When sending the response, a request handler might send plain text, HTML, or JSON, or any number of other content types.  A request handler must either send a response or call the error handler to send a response.  Otherwise the request from the caller will wait until timeout.

Route handlers and middleware frequently do asynchronous operations, often for database access.  While the async request is being processed, other requests may come to the server, and they are dispatched as usual.  Route handlers and middleware may be declared as async, so that the async/await style of programming can be used.  These functions don't return a value of interest.

## **Middleware Functions, Route Handlers, and Error Handling**

Let's sum up common characteristics of middleware functions and response handlers.  Let's also

1. They are each called with the parameters req and res, or possibly req, res, and next.  They may be declared as async functions.

2. Once they are called, these functions do processing based on the information in the req object: method, path, path parameters, query parameters, headers, cookies, the body.  Every request has a method and path, but the other request attributes may or may not be present.

3. These functions must do one of the following, or the request times out:

- Send a response.
- Call next().
- Throw an error.

Even route handlers sometimes call next().  In these cases they call `next(error` to pass the error to the error handler.  Middleware functions often call next() without parameters, to call the next middleware in the chain or the route handler for the request, but they might call `next(error)` in some cases.

4. If next(error) is called or an error is thrown, the error handler is called and passed the error. In Express 5, this happens even if the error occurs while an async middleware function or route handler is waiting on an asynchronous operation. **However, please note:** Middleware functions and route handlers sometimes call functions that have callbacks. You must **never**  throw an error from within a callback, because that would crash the server. Instead, call next(error), which properly passes the error to Expressâ€™s error handling system so it can be handled gracefully without affecting other users.


## **Parsing the Body of a JSON Request**

One very common piece of middleware is the following:

```js
app.use(express.json())
```

This middleware parses the body of a request that has content-type "application/json".  The resulting object is stored in req.body.  There are other body parsers to be used in other circumstances, for example to catch data that is posted from an HTML form.

### **The req and res Objects**

You can access the following elements of the req:

req.method
req.path
req.params  HTML path parameters, if any.  When you configure a route with a route handler, you can tell Express where these are in the URL.
req.query  query parameters of the request, if any
req.body    The body of the request, if any
req.host    The host that this Express app is running on

There are many more.

The req.get(headerName) function returns the value of a header associated with the request, if that header is present.
`req.cookies[cookiename]` returns the cookie of that name associated with request, if one is present.

The res object has the following methods:

res.status()  This sets the HTTP status code
res.cookie()  Causes a Set-Cookie header to be attached to the response.
res.setHeader() Sets a header in the response
res.json()    When passed a JavaScript object, this method converts the object to JSON and sends it back to the originator of the request
res.send()    This sends plain text data, or perhaps HTML.

### **Check for Understanding**

1. What are the parameters always passed to a route handler?  What are they for?

2. What must a route handler always do?

3. How does a middleware function differ from a route handler?

4. If you do an await in a route handler, who has to wait?

5. You add a middleware function or router to the chain with an app.use() statement.  You add a route handler to the chain with an app.get() or similar statement.  Each of these has filter conditions.  How do the filter conditions differ?

### **Answers**

1. A route handler always gets the req and res objects.  The req object contains information from the request, perhaps with additional attributes added by middleware functions.  The res object has methods including res.send() and res.json() that enable the route handler to respond to the request.

2. A route handler must either respond to the request with res.send() or res.json(), or call the error handler with next(error), or throw the error.

3. A middleware function may or may not respond to the request.  Instead it may call next() to pass control to the next handler or middleware function in the chain.  It must either respond to the request or call next, or perhaps throw an error.

4. If you do an await in a route handler, the caller for the request has to wait.  You might be waiting, for example, on a response from the database.  You need the database response before you can send the HTTP response to the caller.  On the other hand, other callers don't have to wait, unless they make a request that ends up at an await statement.

5. An app.use() statement has an optional parameter, which is the path prefix.  You might have a statement like app.use("/api", middlewareFunction), and then middlewareFunction would be called for every request with a path starting with "/api", no matter if it is a GET, a POST, or whatever.  If the path prefix is omitted, the middleware function is called for every request.  An app.get() statement, on the other hand, calls the corresponding route handler only if the path matches exactly and the method is a GET.  In either case, you can pass additional middleware functions as parameters to be called in order, like:

```js
app.use("/api", middleware1, middleware2, middleware3);
app.get("/info", middleware1, infoHandler);
```
