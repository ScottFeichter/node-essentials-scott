# Getting Started with Node Development

Welcome to Code the Dream’s Node/Express class! You will be learning Node.js, an implementation of the JavaScript engine that runs standalone or as a web server. This page describes how to begin. You can develop Node applications on MacOS, Linux, or Windows. If you are developing on Windows, there is no need to do development in a virtual machine, as Node development works fine in Windows native environments, but you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux if you prefer. You will need to install:

- Git
- Node
- Postman
- Postgresql
- The `node-homework` git repository

## Git

The git program is typically already present on MacOS and Linux. You can run

```
git --version
```

to see if it is installed. On Windows, you should install Git for Windows, if you haven’t already. It is available [here.](https://gitforwindows.org/) You will also need an editor. For JavaScript development the VSCode editor is strongly recommended. Finally, you will need to install Node and the Node Package Manager npm. That package is available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You should install the latest LTS version. The other package you need is called Postman. In this class, you create REST APIs. You may have no front end for those APIs, so you need to test them with Postman. The Postman package is available [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## Node

For Windows and Mac, the installer for Node is available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

For Linux, you enter the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

**Verify Node.js and npm installation:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
You should see version numbers for both tools.

## Postgresql

You will learn and use the SQL language for relational database access in this course.  The SQL database we use is called Postgres.  The steps needed to install and configure this package are a little different depending on the platform.

<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Postgresql on Mac</summary>

Enter the following commands in a terminal session.  The `<username>` you use is your Mac username, that is, the value returned by the whoami command.

```bash
brew update
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
psql -U postgres
CREATE ROLE <username> LOGIN CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE nodehomework OWNER <username>;
CREATE DATABASE tasklist OWNER <username>;
CREATE DATABASE testtasklist OWNER <username>;
\q
```

**Verify PostgreSQL installation:**
```bash
psql --version
```
You should see a version number like `psql (PostgreSQL) 14.x`.
</details>

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Postgresql on Windows</summary>

The installer for Postgresql is [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows).  You will need to assign a password for Postgres itself.  Think of one and write it down.  You will be prompted for it during the install.  You will also need a password for `mypguser`.  This is a special Postgres ID to be used for database access. Think of one and write it down.  Of course, don't reuse existing passwords.

Run the install program, accepting all default values.  Once it completes, open the Windows services panel and verify that the Postgresql service is running. Then open a `cmd` prompt (not Git Bash) and type the following, entering the Postgres password when prompted, and substituting the `mypguser` passwrod for `<pg-password>`:

```
"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres -h localhost
CREATE ROLE mypguser LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD ‘<pg-password>’;
CREATE DATABASE nodehomework OWNER mypguser;
CREATE DATABASE tasklist OWNER mypguser;
CREATE DATABASE testtasklist OWNER mypguser;
\q
```
</details>

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Postgresql on Linux</summary>

On Linux (or WSL) Postgres is installed as follows.  The `<username>` is your Linux username, whatever whoami returns.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql 
sudo service posgresql start
sudo -su postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE nodehomework OWNER <username>;
CREATE DATABASE tasklist OWNER <username>;
CREATE DATABASE tasklisttest OWNER <username>;
CREATE ROLE <username> LOGIN CREATEDB; 
\q
```
</details>

### The PostgreSQL Service

The steps above won't ensure that the Postgresql service always starts on Mac or Linux.  If you reboot, it won't automatically start.  This could be fixed, but you don't need it running all the time.  You only need it when working on a Node assignment that uses the database, but you will get error messages if you don't start the service when working on those lessons.

The installation procedure for Windows makes the Postgresql service start automatically.  You could change this to manual in the services panel, starting the service from that panel when you need it.  You don't want your boot times to get longer.

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Additional Steps for Windows</summary

A few additional steps are recommended when setting up a Windows machine for Node development. When you install Git for Windows, you get a terminal shell program called Git Bash. This is the terminal environment you should use for Node development. Do not use cmd.exe or PowerShell, as these terminal environments work differently. With Git Bash, your terminal will work like the LInux or MacOS terminals, so you can enter the same commands as the students with Linux or MacOS. It helps to have some basic understanding of these shell commands: cd, ls, mkdir, touch, pwd. If you are not familiar with these, there is a tutorial [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview). You should always start a Git Bash session to issue git, node, or npm commands. You should also configure git to handle line endings in the Linux way, via these commands:

```
git config --global core.eol lf
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

You should also configure npm to integrate with Git Bash. This is done with the following command:

```
npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```

You should also configure VSCode to handle line ends as Linux does, and to use Git Bash as the terminal shell. Start VSCode from your Git Bash session by typing

```
code .
```

You can then bring up the settings for VSCode by typing Ctrl, (the ctrl key plus the comma). The settings has a Search settings entry field. Type line end in that entry field. You will then be able to set the Eol to /n which is what you want. Then do a Search settings for: terminal integrated default profile windows. This brings up a dropdown, from which you should choose Git Bash. That completes Windows specific setup.

## The `node-homework` Repository

All of your homework, including the class final project, will be created in this repository.  You should install it now. There are also some configuration steps.

Create a repository called `node-homework` in your online github account.  This repository should be created as public, without a README, gitignore, or license file.  Do not fork the `node-homework` repository from Code the Dream.  Copy the URL for your new repository to your clipboard.  Then enter the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/node-homework
git remote set-url origin <URL> # This is the URL of the repository you created.
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/node-homework
git push origin main
npm install
```

Once in a while, it may be necessary to get updates from Code the Dream for some code that's included with this repository.  That is the purpose of the upstream remote.  If this happens, a mentor will post instructions on how to pull down the update.

Create a .env file in the root of the `node-homework` folder.  The format of this file depends on your operating system.

<details>
<summary>The .env file for the Mac</summary>

```
DB_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/nodehomework?host=/tmp
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/tasklist?host=/tmp
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/tasklist?host=/tmp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>The .env file for Windows</summary>

You use the password you created for the `mypguser` Postgres user, substituting that for `<pg-password>` below.  

```
DB_URL=postgresql://mypguser:<pg-password>@localhost/nodehomework
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://mypguser:<pg-password>@localhost/tasklist
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://mypguser:<pg-password>@localhost/testtasklist
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>The .env file for Linux</summary>

```
DB_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/nodehomework?host=/var/run/postgresql
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/tasklist?host=/var/run/postgresql
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>@localhost/tasklist?host=/var/run/postgresql
```

</details>

## Validating Your `node-homework` Configuration

From your `node-homework` folder, run the following:

```bash
node load-db
```

You should see messages that tables have been loaded.  If this doesn't work, ask a mentor or another student for help.  Remember that the Postgresql service must be running when you do this command.

### What is the `load-db.js` file?

The `load-db.js` file is a **database setup script** that:

- **Creates 5 database tables**: customers, employees, products, orders, and line_items
- **Loads sample data** from CSV files in a `./csv/` folder
- **Sets up relationships** between tables (foreign keys)
- **Validates your database connection** is working

When you run `node load-db`, it builds a complete business database system that you'll use for your assignments. Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the `./csv/` folder exists with the required data files.


## Your Assignments

Each of your assignments will be created in the `node-homework` directory.  Before you start work on the assignment, you create a git branch for it.  For example, for the week 1 assignment, you would change to the `node-homework` directory and enter the command

```
git checkout -b assignment1
```

Then, from the `node-homework` folder type `code .` to bring up VSCode for that directory.  It is a good idea to do git add and commit operations several times as you work on an assignment, whenever your code is stable.  You give each commit a meaningful message so that you know how far you got.

When you have finished the week’s assignment, you push it to github as follows:

```
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Completion of week 1 assignment"
git push origin assignment1
```

You then go to github and open your `node-homework` repository. You create a pull request.  Open the assignment submission form for the class. Include a link to your pull request in that form.  **Do not merge the pull request until your reviewer approves it.** Each assignment should be developed in its own feature branch, created from the latest version of the main branch. This keeps your work isolated and avoids carrying over unfinished code from earlier assignments. 
Before creating a new branch, make sure your local `main` branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b assignment2

## The `node-homework` Project Structure

- `assignment1/`, `assignment2/`, ...: Folders for assignments or parts of assignments that are not part of the final project.
- `tdd/`: All TDD for homework assignments.
- `tests/`: For assignment9 on testing.
- `project-links.txt`: Record links to PRs for the React repository and URLs of deployed React and Node apps.  You won't need this until lesson 10.
- Usual Express files (e.g., `app.js`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `utils/`, `models/`, `tests/`, etc.) will be present in the root or as needed for the Node/Express app.
- `package.json`: Single package file for the whole project.
- The repository is structured for cloud deployment.

## Good Luck With the Class, and Happy Coding!
