# Assignment 7 Complete - Advanced Prisma ORM Features

## Enhanced Task Analytics API

### User Analytics Endpoints:
- **GET `/analytics/users/:id`** - Comprehensive user statistics with groupBy aggregation
  - Task completion stats using `prisma.task.groupBy()`
  - Recent task activity with eager loading (`include`)
  - Weekly progress metrics with date grouping
  - Optimized queries to eliminate N+1 problems

- **GET `/analytics/users`** - User list with task counts and pagination
  - All users with task statistics using `_count` aggregation
  - Pending tasks per user (limited to 5 tasks)
  - Pagination with metadata (page, limit, total, hasNext/hasPrev)
  - Selective field loading excluding sensitive data

- **GET `/analytics/tasks/search`** - Advanced text search with raw SQL
  - Cross-table search using `$queryRaw` with PostgreSQL `ILIKE`
  - Relevance scoring with exact matches prioritized
  - Parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention
  - Search across task titles and user names

## Advanced Query Implementation

### Enhanced Task Filtering (GET `/tasks`):
- **Status Filtering** - Filter by completion status (completed/pending)
- **Priority Filtering** - Filter by priority levels (low/medium/high)
- **Text Search** - Case-insensitive search in task titles
- **Sorting** - Sort by different fields (createdAt, title, priority)
- **Pagination** - Offset-based pagination with metadata
- **Selective Fields** - Optimized field selection for performance

### Query Parameters Supported:
- `status` - Filter by completion status
- `priority` - Filter by priority level
- `search` - Text search in titles
- `sort_by` - Field to sort by
- `sort_order` - Ascending or descending
- `page` - Page number for pagination
- `limit` - Items per page

## Database Transactions

### Enhanced User Registration:
- **Transaction-based Registration** - Uses `prisma.$transaction()` for data consistency
- **Welcome Tasks Creation** - Automatically creates 3 welcome tasks for new users
- **Rollback Protection** - If any operation fails, entire transaction is rolled back
- **Atomic Operations** - User creation and task creation happen atomically

### Bulk Operations:
- **POST `/tasks/bulk`** - Batch task creation using `createMany()`
- **Performance Optimization** - Single database operation for multiple tasks
- **Validation** - All tasks validated before batch insertion
- **Success Reporting** - Returns count of successfully created tasks

## Performance Optimization Features

### Pagination Implementation:
- **Offset-based Pagination** - Using `take` and `skip` for all list endpoints
- **Metadata Response** - Complete pagination information in responses
- **Edge Case Handling** - Invalid page numbers and empty results handled
- **Performance Metrics** - Total count and page calculations

### Selective Field Loading:
- **Security Enhancement** - Passwords excluded from all responses
- **Performance Optimization** - Only necessary fields loaded using `select`
- **Relationship Optimization** - Efficient loading of related data with `include`
- **Memory Efficiency** - Reduced payload sizes for better performance

## Advanced Prisma Features Implemented

### Aggregation and Grouping:
- **groupBy Operations** - Task statistics by completion status and date
- **Count Aggregations** - Efficient counting using `_count`
- **Date Grouping** - Weekly progress tracking with date-based grouping
- **Complex Aggregations** - Multi-field grouping for analytics

### Raw SQL Integration:
- **$queryRaw Usage** - Complex search queries with PostgreSQL features
- **Parameterized Queries** - Safe SQL execution with parameter binding
- **Cross-table Joins** - Manual joins for complex search requirements
- **Performance Optimization** - Direct SQL for operations not easily expressed in Prisma

### Transaction Management:
- **Interactive Transactions** - Multi-step operations with rollback capability
- **Data Consistency** - ACID compliance for critical operations
- **Error Handling** - Proper transaction rollback on failures
- **Atomic Operations** - All-or-nothing execution for related operations

## API Endpoints Summary

### User Management:
- **POST `/user`** - Enhanced registration with welcome tasks (transaction-based)
- **POST `/user/logon`** - User login with global session management
- **POST `/user/logoff`** - User logout

### Task Management (Protected):
- **GET `/tasks`** - Advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **POST `/tasks`** - Create single task with priority support
- **POST `/tasks/bulk`** - Batch task creation
- **GET `/tasks/:id`** - Get single task
- **PATCH `/tasks/:id`** - Update task with validation
- **DELETE `/tasks/:id`** - Delete single task

### Analytics (Public):
- **GET `/analytics/users/:id`** - User productivity analytics
- **GET `/analytics/users`** - User list with statistics
- **GET `/analytics/tasks/search`** - Advanced task search

## Technical Enhancements

### Database Schema Updates:
- **Priority Field** - Added priority column to tasks table
- **Enhanced Validation** - Priority validation in Joi schemas
- **Migration Support** - Schema updates with proper field mappings

### Error Handling:
- **Prisma Error Codes** - Proper handling of P2002, P2025, P2003 errors
- **Meaningful Messages** - User-friendly error responses
- **Logging** - Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Performance Features:
- **Query Optimization** - Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Eager Loading** - Relationship data loaded efficiently
- **Batch Operations** - Reduced database round trips
- **Selective Loading** - Only necessary fields retrieved

The assignment demonstrates mastery of advanced Prisma ORM features including complex queries, transactions, aggregations, raw SQL integration, and performance optimization techniques while maintaining a clean, scalable API architecture.
