Assignment Event Handlers, HTTP Servers, and Express
Assignment Instructions
Your assignment files are to be created in the assignment2 folder of your node-homework folder. Create an assignment2 git branch before you start.

Task 1: Practice With An Event Emitter and Listener
Create a file called events.js. Create an emitter. Use an emmitter.on() statement to listen to this emitter for the 'time' event. Whenever the listener receives the event, it should print out "Time received: " followed by the string it receives. Then, call setInterval(callback, 5000). Your callback for the setInterval should emit a 'time' message with the current time as a string. Try it out. You use Ctrl-C to end the program.

Task 2: Practice with the HTTP Server
Modify your sampleHTTP.js. First, add the following to the top of your file:

const htmlString = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Clock</h1>
<button id="getTimeBtn">Get the Time</button>
<p id="time"></p>
<script>
document.getElementById('getTimeBtn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/time');
    const timeObj = await res.json();
    console.log(timeObj);
    const timeP = document.getElementById('time');
    timeP.textContent = timeObj.time;
});
</script>
</body>
</html>
`;
This, of course, is a web page. Then change your logic so that you handle requests for the url "/time. A JSON document should be returned with an attribute "time" that has a value of the current time as a string. Once you've got that code in place, restart your server and test the new URL from your browser. Then, add logic to handle requests for "/timePage". It should return the page above. You will need to set the header content-type to be: "text/html; charset=utf-8". Then restart your server and try that URL. You should see the page, with a button. Click on the button, and you should see the time. The button causes a fetch to your server. You have now coded your first REST API.

Task 3: Creating your First Express Application
You need Express. It is not part of the Node base, so be sure it is installed in your node-homework repository:

npm install express
Actually, your node-homework repository was set up at the start to have all the packages you need -- but if you were setting up your own project, you'd have to do these npm installs.

In the root of node-homework, create a file called app.js, with the following code:

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
try {
  app.listen(port, () =>
    console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}...`),
  );
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
Start this app from your VSCode terminal with:

node app
Go to your browser, and go to the URL http://localhost:3000. Ah, ok, Hello World. It's a start.

This file, app.js, is the first file for your final project. You'll keep adding on to this file and creating modules that it calls.

Let's explain the code. You call express() to create the app. You need a route handler for the app if it is to do anything. The app.get statement tells the app about a route handler function to call when there is an HTTP get for "/". You tell the app to start listening for such requests. By default, it listens on port 3000, but if there is an environment variable set, it will use that value for the port. The listen() statement might throw an error, typically because there is another process listening on the same port. route handlers for an operation on a route are passed two or three parameters. The req parameter gives the properties of the request. The res parameter is used to respond to the request. The other parameter that might be passed is next. When next is passed, it contains another route handler function. If the route handler function for the route doesn't take care of the request, it can pass it on to next().

Be Careful of the Following

Make sure that your route handlers respond to each request exactly once. Stop the server with a Ctrl-C. Make the following change, and then restart the server:

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
//   res.send("Hello, World!");
  console.log("Hello, World")
});
Then try http://localhost:3000 again. Nothing happens, until eventually the browser times out. This is bad. Once again stop the server, make this change, and then restart the server.

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});
In this case, the browser does see a response, but in the server log, you see a bad error message. If you see this error in future development, you'll know what caused it. Now try this (you have to restart the server again.)

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
//   res.send("Hello, World!");
  throw(new Error("something bad happened!"));
});
As you can see, an ugly error appears on your browser screen, as well as in your server log. Every Express application needs an error handler. An error handler in Express is like a route handler, excapt that it has four parameters instead of three. They are err, req, res, and next. Add the following code after your app.get() block:

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`A server error occurred responding to a ${req.method} request for ${req.url}.`, err.name, err.message, err.stack);
  if (!res.headerSent) {
    res.status(500).send("A server error occurred.");
  }
});
Then try the same URL again from your browser. The user sees a terse error message this time, and the server log includes information about what caused the error, some of the useful information in the req object. Note that the error handler checks to see if a response has already been sent. The error might have been thrown after a response was sent, so if you try to send a response again, it will throw an error -- and an error thrown by an error handler would be unfortunate. The error handler is configured with app.use(), which is what you use for middleware. Any request: GET, POST, PATCH, and so on, are handled by this middleware, but only if an error is thrown. The default result code for any send is 200, which means OK, but in this case you are setting it to 500, which means internal server error. If you need to set the status, you do it before you send the response.

At this point, you can put the app.get() for "/" back what it was.

Nodemon

Nodemon saves time. It automatically restarts your app server when you make a code chanage. You install it with:

npm install nodemon --save-dev
You are installing it as a development dependency. You do not want it included in any image deployed to production. Edit your package.json, so that the scripts stanza includes this line:

    "dev": "nodemon app",
Then run npm run dev from the command line. Your server is running, and you can still stop it with a Ctrl-C, but it restarts automatically when you change your code.

Staying Organized
You don't want all your Express code in app.js. That would be a mess. There are standard ways to organize it. The error handler is middleware. So create a middleware folder. Within it, create a file called error-handler.js. Do an npm install of http-status-codes. You use the values in this component instead of numbers like 500. Put this code in error-handler.js:

const { StatusCodes } = require("http-status-codes");
const errorHandlerMiddleware = (err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(
    "Internal server error",
    err.constructor.name,
    JSON.stringify(err, ["name", "message", "stack"]),
  );
  if (!res.headerSent) {
    return res
      .status(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
      .send("An internal server error occurred.");
  }
};

module.exports = errorHandlerMiddleware;
Then in app.js, take out the error handler code and substitute this:

const errorHandler = require("./middleware/error-handler");
app.use(errorHandler);
Test the result. In an Express application, the error handler goes after all of the routes you declare. You can now take the throw() statement out of your app.get(), and put the send of "Hello, World" back in.

Within your route handlers, you may have expected or unexpected errors being thrown. Suppose a user tries to register with an email address that has already been registered. Suppose you have configured the database to require unique email addresses. In this case, the database call returns an error you can recognize. You can catch it in your route handler and give the user an appropriate message. However, the database might give an unexpected error, for example if it is down. In this case, you may as well let the error handler take care of things. An unexpected error might occur outside of a try block. In this case it is passed to the error handler automatically. An unexpected error might occur within a try block of your route handler. Within your catch block, you see that it is not one of the errors you expected. You can just throw the error, or better, call next(err) to pass it on to the error handler.

More Middleware

Try this URL: http://localhost:3000/nonsense. Again you get an error -- a 404. You've seen those. You need to handle this case. Create a file ./middleware/not-found.js. You need a req and a res, but no next in this case. You return StatusCodes.NOT_FOUND and the message You can't do a ${req.method} for ${req.url}. Export your function and add the needed require() and app.use() statements in app.js. Every Express application has a 404 handler like this. You put it after all the routes, but before the error handler. Then test it out.

The middleware you have created so far is a little unusual, because in these there is no call to next(). Often middleware is, as you might expect, in the middle. A middleware function runs for some or all routes before the route handlers for those routes, but then, instead of calling res.send() or an equivalent, it calls next() to pass the work on. Note: There are two ways to call next(). If you call next() with no parameters, Express calls the next route handler in the chain. Sometimes the only one left is the not-found handler. But if you call next(e), e should be an Error object. In this case the error handler is called, and the error is passed to it.

Exiting Cleanly

Your Express program opens a port. You need to be sure that port is closed when the program exits. If there are other open connections, such as database connections, they must also be cleaned up. If not, you may find that you program becomes a zombie process, and that the port you had been listening on is still tied up. This is especially important when you are running a debugger or an automated test. Here is some code to put at the bottom of app.js to ensure a clean exit.

let isShuttingDown = false;
async function shutdown() {
  if (isShuttingDown) return;
  isShuttingDown = true;
  console.log('Shutting down gracefully...');
  // Here add code as needed to disconnect gracefully from the database
};

process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught exception:', err);
  shutdown();
});
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason) => {
  console.error('Unhandled rejection:', reason);
  shutdown();
});
Task 4: Add a Post Route Handler
Modify your app.js. Add an app.post() for "/testpost". Send something back. Then test this new route handler using Postman. You do not need to put anything in the body.

Task 5: Add Logging Middleware
Modify your Express app.js. Add an app.use() statement, above your other routes. You can declare this middleware function inline, in app.js. The middleware function you add should do a console.log() of the req.method, the req.path, and the req.query. Don't forget to call next(), as this is middleware. Then start the server and try sending various requests to your server from your browser, to see the log messages. You could also try post requests using Postman. The req.query object gives the query parameters. You can add them into your request from your browser or from Postman by putting something like ?height=7&color=brown to the end of the URL you send from your browser or Postman. This middleware is useful -- it could help with debugging. We haven't explained how to get req.body, but eventually you could get that as well.

There is no TDD for this week.
