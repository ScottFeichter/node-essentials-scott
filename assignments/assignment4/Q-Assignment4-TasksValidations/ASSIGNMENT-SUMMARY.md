# Assignment 4 Complete - Tasks and Validations

## Task Routes Implementation

### Protected Task Routes (Authentication Required):
- **POST `/tasks`** - Create new task for logged-on user
- **GET `/tasks`** - Get all tasks for logged-on user  
- **GET `/tasks/:id`** - Get specific task by ID
- **PATCH `/tasks/:id`** - Update specific task by ID
- **DELETE `/tasks/:id`** - Delete specific task by ID

### Authentication Middleware:
- **`middleware/auth.js`** - Protects all task routes, requires logged-on user
- Returns 401 UNAUTHORIZED if no user is logged on
- Allows request to proceed to task controller if authenticated

### Task Controller Features:
- **Task Counter** - Closure-based unique ID generation for tasks
- **Memory Storage** - Tasks stored in user's tasklist array
- **CRUD Operations** - Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Proper Status Codes** - CREATED, OK, NOT_FOUND responses

## Validation Implementation

### User Validation (`userSchema.js`):
- **Email** - Trimmed, lowercase, valid email format, required
- **Name** - Trimmed, 3-30 characters, required
- **Password** - 8+ chars, upper/lower case, number, special character, required
- **Custom Messages** - Clear error messages for password requirements

### Task Validation (`taskSchema.js`):
- **Create Schema** - Title (3-30 chars, required), isCompleted (boolean, defaults false)
- **Patch Schema** - Title and isCompleted optional, but at least one required
- **Validation Messages** - Clear error feedback for invalid data

### Validation Features:
- **Joi Library** - Comprehensive validation with custom rules
- **Data Transformation** - Email lowercase conversion, trimming whitespace
- **Error Handling** - BAD_REQUEST status with detailed error messages
- **Abort Early False** - Returns all validation errors, not just first

## Password Security Implementation

### Secure Password Handling:
- **Scrypt Hashing** - Cryptographically secure password hashing
- **Salt Generation** - Random 16-byte salt per password
- **Hash Storage** - Only hashed passwords stored, never plain text
- **Timing Safe Comparison** - Prevents timing attacks during login

### Security Functions:
- **`hashPassword()`** - Creates salt + hash for new passwords
- **`comparePassword()`** - Verifies login passwords against stored hash
- **Async Operations** - Proper async/await handling for crypto operations

## Key Technical Features:

### Route Protection:
- Authentication middleware guards all task operations
- Users can only access their own tasks
- Proper 401 responses for unauthorized access

### Data Management:
- In-memory task storage per user
- Unique task ID generation with closure
- Task list initialization on first task creation

### Input Validation:
- Comprehensive Joi schemas for users and tasks
- Different validation rules for create vs update operations
- Proper error responses with validation details

### Security Best Practices:
- Password hashing with salt
- No plain text password storage
- Secure password comparison
- Protected route implementation

## API Endpoints Summary:

### User Management:
- POST `/user` - Register (with validation & password hashing)
- POST `/user/logon` - Login (with password verification)
- POST `/user/logoff` - Logout

### Task Management (Protected):
- POST `/tasks` - Create task (validated)
- GET `/tasks` - List all user tasks
- GET `/tasks/:id` - Get single task
- PATCH `/tasks/:id` - Update task (validated)
- DELETE `/tasks/:id` - Delete task

The assignment demonstrates understanding of authentication middleware, input validation, secure password handling, and RESTful API design with proper CRUD operations.
