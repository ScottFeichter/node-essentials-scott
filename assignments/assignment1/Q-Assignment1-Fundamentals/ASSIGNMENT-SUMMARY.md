# Assignment 1 Complete

## Files Created:
1. **`node-fundamentals.md`** - Comprehensive answers about Node.js fundamentals, V8 engine, use cases, and module systems
2. **`globals-demo.js`** - Demonstrates Node.js global objects (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`, custom globals)
3. **`async-demo.js`** - Shows three async patterns (callbacks, promises, async/await) with proper error handling
4. **`core-modules-demo.js`** - Uses `os`, `path`, and `fs` modules with streaming demonstration
5. **`sample-files/`** directory with:
   - `sample.txt` - Contains "Hello, async world!" for async demos
   - `demo.txt` - Created by fs.promises operations
   - `largefile.txt` - 100-line file for streaming demonstration

## Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ All async patterns output "Hello, async world!" as required
- ✅ Proper error handling with try/catch
- ✅ File streaming with configurable chunk size (1KB)
- ✅ System information logging
- ✅ Path operations demonstration
- ✅ Custom global variables

The assignment demonstrates understanding of Node.js fundamentals, asynchronous programming patterns, and core modules usage. All scripts run successfully and produce the expected output.
